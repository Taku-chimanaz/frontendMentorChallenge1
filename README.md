## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

I have learnt about how to use grid layouts and obtain a maximum height of a given grid areas and flex area.



```css
  .image {
    margin-bottom: 1.5em;
    background: linear-gradient(rgba(98, 20, 114, 0.5), rgba(157, 21, 175, 0.5)), url("images/image-header-mobile.jpg");
    flex: .5;
    background-size: cover;
    background-position: center;
    border-radius: 10px;
    height: 100%;
    
}
````



### Continued development

I will need to focus more on the responsive designs and css grids
